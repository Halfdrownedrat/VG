# Notes

## System types
### Difference Active-Passive System
Active:
- Air pumps for increased plant/root growth and less stale water.
- Water pumps for water circulation
Passive:
- No pumps
- Less moving parts --> Less expensive
- Way more labor intensive
- Risk of algae growth or root spoilage

### Difference Circulation-Non Circulating System
A circulating system constantly pumps water (in intervals) through the system, ensuring a steady stream of fresh water and oxygen for the roots. A non-circulating system fills up once and only changes water with the water change.

### Wick system
- Very old and simple
- Passive system (non-circulating)
- Capillary effect pulls the solution to the roots
- Limited water transfer --> Inefficient and low returns
- Plants:
  - Water-saving herbs
  
### Deepwater culture
- Simple 
- Passive system (non-circulating)
- High returns
- Roots are always (partly) submerged
- High risk of oxygen deprivation --> Air pump highly recommended
- Plants:
  - Leafy greens with low O² demand
  - NOT deep-rooting plants
  
### Ebb and flood system
- Active, (circulating)
- High returns
- Pump and valve periodically empty and fill the root area
- Getting the cycles right is tricky
- Good O² flow
- Plants:
  - Plants from dry and wet areas
  - Big, blooming plants (tomatoes, cucumbers)
  - Mediterranean herbs
  
### Drip system
- Active, (non-circulating but not always)
- Very water efficient
- Feeds plants using small tubes, excess is collected and reused
- Requires more tech but allows more control
- Plants:
  - Allows any kind but requires correct values
  
### Nutrient-film-system (NFT-System)
- Active, (circulating)
- Thin stream of solution flows down an angled pipe along the roots
- Efficient
- Plants die extremely fast when a malfunction happens
- Plants:
  - Salads and herbs
  - NOT heavy, strong rooting plants
  - Raspberries
  
### Aeroponic System
- Most modern of them all
- Active, (circulating)
- Roots are hanging freely and get sprayed with a solution mist
- High cost for high returns

## "Soil" types
Normally the soil would contain all the nutrients, in hydroponics it "only" fixes the plants in place and sometimes stores moisture. The nutrients are delivered through a solution containing clean water and (diluted) nutrients.

There are different demands for the substrate which no single substrate can fully fulfill:
- pH Value < 6.5
- High Capillarity
- High Air Capacity
- Low Salt Content
- High Water Capacity 
- High Structural Stability
- Good Re-wettability
- Suitable Nutrient Content
- Low Microbial Activity
- Free from Weeds and Pests

To save space and sanity, I will shorten some things. 
Water-Capacity: WC (Ability to store water)   
pH-Value: pH   
Air-Capacity: AC (Ability to store air/oxygen)   
Cation Exchange Capacity: CEC (Ability to store and give nutrients)

## Construction
### I. Romeo
- 3 storage passiv, non-circulating system
- 3. Level: Wick System, 2. and 1. Level Deepwater System
- Wooden Frame
- Growth Light
- Manual Drainage and refilling
- **Material list**
  - 3 container, plastic
  - wooden beams large for main support
  - wooden beams slightly thinner for crossbeams
  - thin wooden plates for cover
  - metall angles
  - metall movign lock to secure canister (-doors)
  - 3 valves
  - gardening tubes (to cleanly drain the water)
  - netcups or repurposed plasic/ gardening cups
  - some substrate (preferably clay pebbles, if not -->kitchen sponge and prayers)
  - Highly recommended but not needet: Aquarium pump


### II. Florian
- also named "The Cube"
- active, circulating
- really tiny and compact system
- ebb and flow system
- upper tank has plants in them, lower tank is cycle canister
- box is completly incased with artifical lighting and fans for ventilation (+maybe a heater/ cooler)
- **Material list**
  - 2 Container (1 for plant, 1 for cycle)
  - electric Valve
  - gardening pump
  - wooden beams for frame
  - wooden panels/ plates for cover
  - electric fan (+maybe tempertue unit/ heater)
  - growth light

### III. Rattenlinie Nord
- didn´t want to name it Glücksburg or artefact so now we have a politcal name that fits the region
- It´s just a working title so don´t complain
- Multi Store, Modular Pipe based system
  - Can add or remove pipes
  - pipes can have different hole configurations
- Propably NFT system, maybe Ebb-Flood System (Ebb-Flood is in theory simplet but it requires a shit ton of valves and pumps while NFT only needs one pump)
- water from higher layers drops in lower layers like a marble race track
- needs calculation for pipe throughput, max pump height, pump throughput/sec and also weight if I build it large


### Definitly needet tools
- Spraypaint, paint (plastic, wood)
- sandpaper (for roughing smooth surfaces that need paint)
- powerdrill (Akkuschrauber)
- holecutting heads or sharp knife (when cutting holes for pipe connections or the holes for the cups)
- hot water/flame (to soften rubber tubes before attaching them so they retract and stick)
- Wood screws
- underlayrings (unterlegscheiben)
- metall wire
- buckets and chute for water transport and pouring

### Needet for every system
- Strong baseplate that doesn´t mind water spillage/ high weights
- heavy duty rolers (with brakes) (I want all systems to be movable)

### Making wood last
- fill in holes with wooden pieces and wood glue or epoxy
- sand surface
- first primer or wachs
- second layer if needet
- use hard woods like: 
(might be smart to ask bjørn or axel for advice)

### Working with piping
- For inflexible pipes (pvc, hard plastic pipes)
  - clean both surfaces
  - apply lube like soap or fat to one piece
  - violently jam it in
  - use pipes with rubber rings in them if the parts are expected to have more duty
- flexible pipes (gardening pipes, straws, pumping stuff)
  - heat before jamming together to soften material
  - do not lubricate
- generally
  - use Dichtband if they sizes are not perfect fit
  - fix any holes immidiatly, they only get bigger
  - build with the thought in mind that pipes and tubes need to get cleaned and sometimes replaced
- fixing poor cuts or leakages
  - Teerpappe wirkt wunder (more usefull for thicker plastic, astheticly ugly and quite thick, might need a burner for fixing)
  - Dichtband
  - welding (with hot iron) other plastic parts on
  - zipties and Schlauchklemmen


## Cleaning/ repairing farms
- shut down electronics (view electronics section for more info)
- disconnect any electricity, move outside or into a working area
- drain water
- disconnect sensores and put them in a safe place
- flush system with fresh, clean water a few times
- dissesabmle if needet (doing it to have needlessly wears out the parts and costs time)

## Problems with algea/ germs
- usually means:
  - too warm
  - unclean water/ solution/ Fertilizer/ substrate
  - sunlight impact on water (algea needs photosintecis to function)
- how to fix:
  - do normal cleanup but with strong soap/ aquarium cleaner , flush with clean water

## Growth lights
### Why

### Different Types

### Note on choosing

## Specilized parts/modules I want
Most of those parts need massiv refitting, a lot of money and/or a 3d printer, therefore I put them seperate from the other stuff.
### Solution Mixer
- container with premixed solution or just the pure nutrient solution
- bottles with nutrients, each connected to their own valve/ pump
- programm decides wich nutrients it needs to add for a perfect mixture
- needs either manual analysis or analyzer module
### Waste Water Treatment
- either gets send to solution mixer or just:
- ...cleaned, "refueled" and send back into the system
### Hanging Garden
- really pointless but kinda funny module
- plabts are either overflowing over the sides or literally hanging instead of growing up
- creates challange of water delivery without soaking the plant
### Analyzer module
- takes sample from the water and does more complex data collection (semi) autonoms
- could always "dripfeed" a pipetting palette and thren drop samples in them, the data then gets either visually taken or analyzed using an AI (image recognition software)
### Algea Grower
- why fight algea when I can use my "wastewater" for deliberatly growing it 
- entire system needs to use fertelizer that doesnt have any "anti-algea" stuff in it
- might need additional fertelizer
### Fish
- a fish tank that cleans the water and produces nutrient solution (water with fish shit)
### Auto Harvest/ Replant
- only usefull for stuff that gets harvested as one piece (salad heads for example)
- robotic arm that rips out plant, throws it into cleaning basked
- puts pregrown seeds into "field"
- Re-seeds the baby field
- needs a lot of mechanical moving parts and relativly high precsion
- really unnessary for fields my size
### Piping network
- network of pipes through my appartment
- auto-deliver water directly from the source to the farms and back
- can´t do that in a rented appartment 
- high risk of massive water damage
- needs heavy maintanace
