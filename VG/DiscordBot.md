# Discord Bot Inegration
## Idea
Since I have the system running on an raspberry isntead of an arduino, I might as well have other services like PiHole, DIscord bots, websites... running.
It also serves the dedicated purpose of logging everything into specific channels that I can easily add people to.

## Choosing style/ language
The bot can be codet in diffenerent languages but since I only need it to send plain text messages without any user interaction AND some parts need python, I will choose python.
(ItÂ´s also the most easy to use)
